# Method

## High-level view of the model architecture

The high-level view of th model architecture is as follows.       
<img src="images/model_architecture.png"  width="700" height="370">

There are three main modules in the proposed model (PIG) 
      
* Graph Learning Layer (GLL) 
    * learns the feature relationships in a way that helps imputation and prediction. 
* Graph Residual Imputation Layer (GRIL) 
    * corrects the imputation residuals of an initial imputed matrix. 
* Prediction Layer (PL) 
    * makes final imputation and outputs predictions.

## Graph Learning Layer (GLL)
<img src="images/graph_learning_with_label.png"  width="700" height="370">
    
* The key idea of GLL is to locate embedding vectors of relevant features as close as possible.     
* We use source- and destination- embedding matrices to generate a directed adjacency matrix.

## Graph Residual Imputation Layer (GRIL)
<img src="images/graph_residual_learning_with_label.png"  width="700" height="370">
There are two key processes in this layer.              

* Relation Graph Convolution: We use relevant features to estimate residuals of the complement matrix.
* Residual Connection: we use the estimated residuals to “correct” the “complement matrix”

## Prediction Layer (PL)
<img src="images/prediction_head.png"  width="700" height="370">
We simply used one-layer fully-connected-network for the prediction layer.

                 

## Training Strategy
When training the model, we consider two problems.        
1. The need for balancing tasks (avoid conflicting gradients)
2. To guide PIG to learn how to impute not to reconstruct.
    * Example) Identity mapping (the same as the complement matrix)
    <img src="images/identity_mapping_of_GRIL.png">
    PIG can easily reduce the imputation loss simply by repeating the input.
              
               
* Two step learning

Our training strategy is decently summarized in the below figure.
<img src="images/two_step_training.png">

* Step 1    
    (1) Pretrain Graph Learning Layer and Prediction Layer independently.      
    (2) Obtain prior feature relationships.      
    Both are trained using complete data (w/o missing values).

* Step 2    
    Multi-task learning on both imputation and prediction.      
    We randomly mask the observed values at every forward process of a mini-batch.
